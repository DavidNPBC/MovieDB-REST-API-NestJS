## Coding Challenge

This was a coding challenge I did in 72h.
I was challenged to do the backend part of a project that would store movies in a database.
I was challenged to do it in technology I had never worked with and managed to complete the challenge
The technology is Nest.JS and Typescript

## Running the app

To run the app just enter npm start run:prod or npm start run:dev
Then you can use postman to interact with the data
This project uses MySQL as the database and assumes you have a root user with no password
